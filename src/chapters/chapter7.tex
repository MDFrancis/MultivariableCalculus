Multivariable calculus has a long history with many refinements over the years.
Every once in a while, a mathematician will notice something new---a connection
between various concepts in mathematics.  You may have notices that much
of what we have done was not particular to any specific dimension, but the problems
we solved were usually in $\R^2$ and $\R^3$.  The theoretical framework
for work in $\R^4$ (like is often required for relativity) is set, but how
would we actually compute a surface integral in $\R^4$?  We would need
to find the volume form/surface element without the use of the cross product.

\emph{Differential forms}\index{differential forms} are one solution to this issue.
They recast many of the fundamental ideas, gradients, curl, divergence,
line integrals, surface integrals, etc., in a unified framework that works
regardless of dimension and \emph{regardless of coordinate system}.
Because of their abstract foundation, they are not typically encountered in a
first course on multivariable calculus, but that has more to do with culture
than anything else.

\section{Abstract Foundation for Differential Forms}

Differential forms have close ties with calculus and linear algebra.
For that reason, we will use some terms from linear algebra, including the
abstract idea of a \emph{vector}\index{vector space}.

\begin{definition}[Vector Space]
	A set $V$, coupled with an addition and a
	scalar multiplication is called a \emph{vector space} if
	the following properties hold for all $\vec u,\vec v,\vec w\in V$
	and all scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
	\begin{align*}
		\vec u+\vec v\in V\quad&\text{and}\quad \alpha\vec u\in V\tag{Closure}\\
		(\vec u+\vec v)+\vec w&=\vec u+(\vec v+\vec w)\tag{Associativity}\\
		\vec u + \vec v - \vec v &= \vec u+\vec 0 = \vec u\tag{Identity}\\
		\vec u+\vec v&=\vec v+\vec u\tag{Commutativity}\\
		\alpha(\vec u+\vec v)&=\alpha\vec u+\alpha \vec v\tag{Distributivity}\\
		(\alpha\beta)\vec v&=\alpha(\beta \vec v)\tag{Scalar Associativity}\\
		(\alpha+\beta)\vec v&=\alpha\vec v+\beta \vec v\tag{Scalar Distributivity}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

These properties should look familiar from Section \ref{SECVECTORPROPS}, and indeed
$\R^n$ is a real vector space.  However there are many seemingly non-geometric
sets that are also vector spaces.

\begin{example}
	Let $V=\Set{\text{functions from }\R\text{ to }\R}$ equipped with
	pointwise addition and scalar multiplication.  Then $V$ is a vector space.

	We won't prove every property in detail, but if we pick $f,g\in V$,
	we need the quantities $f+g$ and $\alpha f$ to make sense and to also
	be in $V$.  This becomes almost trivially true, thanks to the definition
	of addition of functions.

	Let $h=f+g$.  By definition $h(x) = f(x)+g(x)$, and so $h$ is
	a function from $\R$ to $\R$.  Therefore $h\in V$.  Further
	$q=\alpha h$ is defined by $q(x) = \alpha h(x)$, and so $q\in V$.
	Thus, $V$ satisfies the closure property.  The rest of the properties
	follow via similar arguments.
\end{example}

Recall that if $\vec v_1,\ldots, \vec v_n\in V$ are vectors, then 
$\vec w=\alpha_1\vec v_1+\cdots +\alpha_n\vec v_n$ is a 
\emph{linear combination}\index{linear combination} of the vectors $\vec v_1,\ldots \vec v_n$.
Another way to think of a vector space is as a set on which linear combinations
make sense.

Now that we have abstract ``vectors'' (elements of a vector space), let's
get abstract lines and planes.  These objects can be defined using
\emph{linear functions}\index{linear transformation} which are equivalently
called \emph{linear transformations}\footnote{ The words \emph{function},
\emph{transformation}, and \emph{mapping} are synonymous in math.  We like
to mix it up some times.}.

\begin{definition}[Linear]
	Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces and let
	$T:V\to W$ be a function.  $T$ is called \emph{linear}
	if for all $\vec u,v\in V$ and all scalars $\alpha$,
	\[
		T(\vec u+\vec v) = T(\vec u)+T(\vec v)\qquad\text{and}\qquad
		T(\alpha \vec v) = \alpha T(\vec v).
	\]
\end{definition}
If a transformation is linear, it is typical to omit parenthesis when
passing in a single vector.  That is, instead of writing $T(\vec v)$,
we write $T\vec v$, but we would always write $T(\vec u+\vec v)$
with parenthesis.

We have already encountered many linear functions.  For example, 
consider $f:\R^3\to\R$ where
$f(\vec v) = \xhat\cdot \vec v$.  Based on the properties of the dot product,
\[
	f(\vec u+\vec v) = \xhat\cdot (\vec u+\vec v)=
	\xhat\cdot \vec u+\xhat \cdot \vec v = f(\vec u)+f(\vec v)
\]
and 
\[
	f(\alpha \vec v) = \xhat \cdot (\alpha \vec v) = \alpha \xhat \cdot \vec v
	=\alpha f(\vec v).
\]

Another linear transformation that we have encountered is projection\index{projection}.
For a fixed vector $\vec u$, let $f:\R^3\to\R^3$ be defined by 
$f(\vec v) = \Proj_{\vec u} \vec v$.

\begin{exercise}
	Show that for a fixed $\vec u$, the function 
	$f(\vec v) = \Proj_{\vec u} \vec v$ is linear.
\end{exercise}

Linear functions help us define lines, planes, etc. via their \emph{kernel}\index{kernel}.

\begin{definition}[Kernel]
	For a function $T:V\to W$, the \emph{kernel} (or \emph{null space}
	if $T$ is a linear function)
	of $T$ is defined to be 
	\[
		\Ker(T) = \Set{\vec v\in V\given T(\vec v) = \vec 0}.
	\]
\end{definition}

Thinking at this level of abstraction can be challenging at first,
but we've really been working with these ideas for a long time.

For example, let $\vec n = (1,2,3)$ and let $P:\R^3\to\R$ be defined by
$P(\vec v) = \vec n\cdot \vec v$.  We've already seen that $P$ is linear.
What is $\Ker(P)$?  Well,
\[
	P\mat{x\\y\\z} = \mat{1\\2\\3}\cdot \mat{x\\y\\z} = 
	x+2y+3z=0
\]
exactly when $(x,y,z)$ lies on the plane through the origin with normal vector $\vec n$.

Lines can be written as kernels as well.

\begin{exercise}
	Let $\vec d=(1,1,1)$.  Find a linear transformation $L$ so that
	$\Ker(L)$ is the line through $\vec 0$ with direction vector $\vec d$.
	(It may help to think of a line as the intersection of two planes.)
\end{exercise}

Unfortunately, linear functions cannot describe \emph{all} ``flat''
objects.  The kernel of a linear function always contains $\vec 0$, and
so lines and planes that do not pass through the origin cannot be described
as kernels of linear functions.  However, they can be described as kernels
of the related \emph{affine functions}\index{affine function}.

\begin{definition}[Affine Function]
	Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces.  A function $A:V\to W$ is called
	\emph{affine} if there exists some $\vec w\in W$ and some linear transformation
	$T:V\to W$ so that
	\[
		A(\vec v) = T(\vec v) + \vec w
	\]
	for all $\vec v$.
\end{definition}

You may recall the previously, in Section \ref{SECAFFINE},
we only defined what it means for a function $f:\R^n\to \R$
to be affine.
We now have a fully general
definition!

\begin{exercise}
	Write the plane with normal vector $\vec n=(1,2,3)$ and which
	passes through the point $\vec p=(1,1,1)$ as the kernel of an 
	affine function.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Covectors}

Now that we have formulated standard geometric objects, we will develop
a set of tools to \emph{measure} those objects.  The first
property we will attempt to measure is displacement.  From displacement,
we will be able to measure area as ``displacement in two directions''
and volume as ``displacement in three directions.''

Displacement is measures with objects called \emph{covectors}\index{covector}.
In other contexts, these objects are also known as 
\emph{linear functionals}\index{linear functional} or \emph{dual vectors}\index{dual vector}.
We will typically write covectors in a bold font them from vectors.

\begin{definition}[Covector]
	Given a vector space $V$, a \emph{covector} on the space $V$
	is a linear function $\bm{\alpha}:V\to \R$.  The set of all
	covectors on $V$ is denoted $V^*$.
\end{definition}

This definition is very abstract, but again, we've encountered covectors
before!  Let $\bm{\alpha}:\R^3\to\R$ be defined by $\bm{\alpha}(\vec v) =\xhat \cdot \vec v$.
We already know that $\bm{\alpha}$ is linear and that it outputs
real numbers.  Therefore it is a covector.  However, $\bm \alpha$ also has
geometric meaning.  It $\bm\alpha(\vec v)$ outputs the $x$-coordinate
of $\vec v$.  We could similarly think of covectors that when given
a vector output its $y$ or $z$ coordinates.

Any function $\bm f:\R^n\to \R$ defined by $\bm f(\vec v) = \vec r\cdot \vec v$
for some fixed $\vec r$ is a covector.  Further, we can interpret
$\bm f$ to have geometric meaning.  The quantity $\bm f(\vec v)$ is how
much $\vec v$ points in the direction $\vec r$.  In other words, $\bm f(\vec v)$
is the ``$\vec r$ component'' of $\vec v$ (is anyone else thinking
about projections?).

A theorem from linear algebra shows us that this type of covector
is all there is (in $\R^n$, at least).

\begin{theorem}
	Let $\bm\alpha:\R^n\to \R$ be a covector for $\R^n$.  Then,
	there exists a $\vec a\in \R^n$ such that
	\[
		\bm\alpha (\vec v) = \vec a\cdot \vec v
	\]
	for all $\vec v\in\R^n$.
\end{theorem}


Now we know all covectors for $\R^n$ have a geometric meaning
as measuring some component of an input vector.  The following
theorem says that the term ``vector'' in co\emph{vector} is justified.

\begin{theorem}
	If $V$ is a vector space, then $V^*$, the set of all
	covectors for $V$ is also a vector space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	XXX Finish
\end{proof}

We won't be doing much with the abstract vector space $V^*$, but it is
nice to know that we can take linear combinations of covectors
and still get a covector\footnote{ If we wanted to investigate $V^*$,
we might start by saying, since $V^*$ is a vector space, there is
a set $V^{**}$ of covectors for $V^*$.  Another linear algebra theorem
says $V\subseteq V^{**}$, if you interpret ``subset'' in the right sense. }.

It is, however, worth our time to consider $(\R^n)^*$.  Recall that
in $\R^3$ we have special vectors $\xhat$, $\yhat$, and $\zhat$,
called the standard basis for $R^3$,
and all other vectors can be written as a linear combination of these.
Higher dimensions also have the idea of a standard basis, and there
is a similar concept for sets of covectors.

\begin{definition}[Standard Basis]
	The \emph{standard basis} for $\R^n$ is notated 
	by $\vec e_1,\vec e_2,\ldots,\vec e_n$ and satisfies that 
	every vector in $\R^n$ can be written as a linear combination of
	$\vec e_1,\vec e_2,\ldots,\vec e_n$ and that
	\[
		\vec e_i\cdot \vec e_j = \begin{cases}
			1 &\text{ if } i=j\\
			0 &\text{ if } i\neq j
		\end{cases}.
	\]

	The standard basis for $(\R^n)^*$ is notated
	$\bm e^1,\bm e^2,\ldots,\bm e^n$ and satisfies that
	every covector for $\R^n$ can be written as a linear combination of
	$\bm e^1,\bm e^2,\ldots,\bm e^n$ and that
	\[
		\bm e^i(\vec e_j) = \begin{cases}
			1 &\text{ if } i=j\\
			0 &\text{ if } i\neq j
		\end{cases}.
	\]
\end{definition}

Following the convention from physics, we index covectors using superscripts
and regular vectors using subscripts.  In plain terms, the standard basis for
$\R^n$ is a collection of unit vectors that point along the coordinate axes\footnote{
Technically, the standard basis \emph{defines} the coordinate axes.}, and the
standard basis for $(\R^n)^*$ picks off the standard coordinates of input
vectors.

It's now easy to appreciate that we can take linear combinations of covectors.
For example, let $\bm \alpha = \bm e^1+2\bm e^3$.  We can compute
\[
	\bm \alpha\mat{a\\b\\c} = \bm e^1\mat{a\\b\\c}
	+2\bm e^3\mat{a\\b\\c} = a+2c = \mat{1\\0\\2}\cdot \mat{a\\b\\c},
\]
and so we see that $\bm\alpha$ is given by taking the dot product with
the vector $\mat{1\\0\\2}$.  Of course, we could write $\vec e_1+2\vec e_2$
instead of $\mat{1\\0\\2}$ and $a\vec e_1+b\vec e_2+c\vec e_3$ instead of 
$\mat{a\\b\\c}$.  In doing so, we would be analyzing vectors in
a \emph{coordinate free} manner.  That is, we never need to talk about
the coordinates of a vector in order to do a computation.  One of the selling points
of differential forms is that they allow you to do multivariable calculus
in a coordinate free way.

Stepping back for a moment, the machinery we've developed is almost comically
tautological.  Let $\vec v\in \R^n$ and let $\bm \alpha$ be a covector.  By 
definition,
\begin{align*}
	\vec v &= a_1\vec e_1+\cdots +a_n\vec e_n\\
	\bm \alpha &= b_1\bm e^1+\cdots b_n\bm e^n,
\end{align*}
and it follows that
\[
	\bm \alpha(\vec v) = 
	(b_1\bm e^1+\cdots b_n\bm e^n)(a_1\vec e_1+\cdots +a_n\vec e_n)
	=b_1a_1+\cdots b_na_n = \matc{b_1\\\vdots\\b_n}\cdot \matc{a_1\\\vdots\\
	a_n}.
\]
Thus, while by definition 
\[
\vec v=a_1\vec e_1+\cdots +a_n\vec e_n=
\matc{a_1\\\vdots\\a_n},\]
if we  wrote
\[
	\bm \alpha =b_1\bm e^1+\cdots b_n\bm e^n=
\matc{b_1\\\vdots\\b_n},\]
we would have gone through
a whole lot of work to reinvent the dot product!  It will be worth it 
though\footnote{ Some would argue that dot and cross products confuse
vectors and covectors---that quantities like \emph{force}
are naturally covectors, and that physics should be taught
with covectors (instead of dot products) from the beginning.}.


\subsection{Covectors as Rulers}

\section{1-forms and Line Integrals}

Recall that a function $f:\R^n\to\R^n$ was called a
vector field because to each point in $\R^n$ it assigns a
vector in $\R^n$.  A 1-form is a type of \emph{differential 
form}\index{differential form} that is analogous to a vector field
except that instead of assigning to each point a vector,
it assigns to each point a \emph{covector}.  We will also write
1-forms using a bold font.

\begin{definition}[1-form]
	A \emph{1-form}\index{1-form} on the space $\R^n$ is a function
	$\bm \alpha: \R^n\to (\R^n)^*$.
\end{definition}
We will always assume our 1-forms are \emph{smooth}---that is, every 1-form
can be differentiated as much as we like\footnote{ We haven't defined
what it means to differentiate a function whose codomain consists of covectors.
The quick and dirty answer is, treat covectors as vectors and use
the definition of differentiability for a vector field.}.

Since 1-forms output covectors which themselves measure vectors, it is worth
introducing some notation.  If $\bm \alpha$ is a 1-form, then
$\bm \alpha(\vec v)$ is a covector.  If we wish to apply this
covector, $\bm\alpha(\vec v)$,
to measure the vector $\vec w$, we write $\Big[\bm\alpha(\vec v)\Big](\vec w)$.
We'll be doing this a lot, so we have the alternative notation
\[
	\bm\alpha\formarg{\vec v}{\vec w}  \equiv\Big[\bm\alpha(\vec v)\Big](\vec w).
\]


As we've seen, covectors are used to measure vectors, and 
vectors themselves come from displacements.  1-forms are a way
to measure \emph{oriented curves}.  We'll explore this by
first considering some special 1-forms on $\R^3$.

\begin{definition}[Standard Basis for 1-forms]
	The
	\emph{standard basis for 1-forms} are the 1-forms
	$\dd x$, $\dd y$, and $\dd z$ defined by
	\[
		\dd x(\vec v) = \bm e^1\qquad \dd y(\vec v)=\bm e^2\qquad
		\dd z(\vec v) = \bm e^3
	\]
	for all $\vec v\in \R^3$.
\end{definition}

The names $\dd x$, $\dd y$, and $\dd z$\index{$\dd x$ $\dd y$ $\dd z$}
are certainly evocative.  When you see
``$\dd$,'' you should think ``displacement.''  After all
$\dd x(\vec v)$ is the covector that measures the $x$ displacement
of a vector.  Soon, you will
also think ``derivative.''

\subsection{Measuring Curves with 1-forms}

Let $\mathcal C\subset \R^3$ be a smooth curve that starts at $\vec a=(a_x,a_y,a_z)$
and ends at $\vec b=(b_x,b_y,b_z)$.  The 1-form $\dd x$ is meant to measure the
displacement of $\mathcal C$ from it's starting point to its ending point.
However, $\dd x$ cannot \emph{directly} interact with $\mathcal C$.
Recall, $\dd x:\R^3\to (\R^3)^*$ is a function that inputs points
and outputs covectors and covectors measure vectors.  $\mathcal C$ certainly
has points, and if we squint our eyes, $\mathcal C$ also has vectors---tangent
vectors!

Let $\vec r:[0,1]\to\mathcal C$ be a parameterization of $\mathcal C$ defined by
\[
\vec r(t) = \mat{r_x(t)\\r_y(t)\\r_z(t)}
\]
so that $\vec r(0)=\vec a$ and $\vec r(1)=\vec b$ (that is, it is oriented 
appropriately). Then, 
\[\vec r'(t) =\mat{r_x'(t)\\r_y'(t)\\r_z'(t)}
\]is a tangent vector to $\mathcal C$ at the
point $\vec r(t)$.

XXX Figure including $\dd x(r)$

Now, $\dd x\circ \vec r = \bm e^1$ is the constant covector that measures
the $x$ displacement of a vector and so $\dd x \formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}
=\bm e^1\big(\vec r'(t)\big)$
is the $x$ displacement of the tangent vector to $\mathcal C$ coming
from the parameterization $\vec r$ at the point $\vec r(t)$.   In other words,
\[
	\dd x\formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}=\bm e^1\big(\vec r'(t)\big) = r_x'(t).
\]
What we're after is the \emph{total} $x$ displacement along the curve $\mathcal C$.
That is $b_x-a_x$.  But, we can get this quantity from the fundamental theorem
of calculus!  After some reverse engineering, we see
\[
	b_x-a_x = \int_0^1 r_x'(t)\, \d t 
	= \int_0^1 \dd x\formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}\,\d t.
\]
Further, this integral works out to the same value regardless of our
choice of parameterization.  If $\vec q$ were another parameterization 
of $\mathcal C$ starting
at $\vec a$ and ending at $\vec b$, then 
\[
\int_0^1 \dd x\formarg{\vec q(t)}{\vec q'(t)}\,\d t=b_x-a_x.
\]
Based on this observation,
we are ready to define what it means to integrate a 1-form.

\begin{definition}[Integral of a 1-form]
	Let $\mathcal C$ be an oriented curve that starts at $\vec a$
	and ends at $\vec b$ and let $\bm \alpha$ be a 1-form.  We define
	the \emph{integral of $\bm \alpha$ over the curve $\mathcal C$}
	by
	\[
		\int_{\mathcal C}\bm\alpha 
		=\int_a^b \bm\alpha \formarg{\vec q(t)}{\vec q'(t)}\,\d t
		= \int_a^b \Big[\bm\alpha\circ \vec q(t)\Big](\vec q'(t))\,\d t
	\]
	where $\vec q:[a,b]\to\mathcal C$ is a parameterization of
	$\mathcal C$ satisfying $\vec q(a)=\vec a$ and $\vec q(b)=\vec b$.
\end{definition}

With this definition, we have a powerful notation.  For an oriented curve $\mathcal C$,
\[
	\int_{\mathcal C} \dd x
\]
is the $x$ displacement from the start of $\mathcal C$ to the end of $\mathcal C$.
Similarly, $\int_{\mathcal C}\dd y$ gives the $y$ displacement and $\int_{\mathcal C}\dd z$
gives the $z$ displacement.

There are many nice properties of the integral notation applied to 1-forms.
For example, it behaves like a classical integral with respect to linear combinations.
If $\bm\alpha$ and $\bm\beta$ are 1-forms and $t$ is a scalar, then
\[
	\int_{\mathcal C}(\bm \alpha + t\bm\beta) = \int_{\mathcal C} \bm\alpha 
	+ t\int_{\mathcal C} \bm\beta.
\]

\begin{exercise}
	Explain in words how to interpret
	the output of $\int_{\mathcal C} (\dd x+\dd y +\dd z)$.
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Non-constant 1-forms}

Let us seek the comfort of a one dimensional space as we explore non-constant 1-forms.
In $\R^1$ we only have one standard basis 1-form: $\dd x$.
Let $f:\R^1\to\R$ be a scalar-valued function.  We will interpret
$\R^1$ as a vector space rather than a set of scalars. Now, define
\[
	f\dd x (\vec v) = f(\vec v)\dd x(\vec v) = f(\vec v)\bm e^1.
\]
That is, $f\dd x$, when given a point, returns a scaled version of $\bm e^1$,
which will in turn measure a scaled version of the $x$ displacement of
a vector.  Let $\mathcal C=[a,b]$ be the oriented interval starting
at $a$ and ending at $b$.  $\mathcal C$ is naturally parameterized
by the function $\vec r:[a,b]\to[a,b]$ defined by $\vec r(t) = t$.
Since $\vec r$ is the identity function, $f\circ \vec r(t)=f(t)$ and
$\vec r'(t) = 1$.
Thus, we may compute
\[
	\int_{\mathcal C} f\dd x = \int_a^b f\circ r(t)\, \dd x\formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}
	\,\d t
	=\int_a^b f(t)\,\d t.
\]
This shows that
$\int_{\mathcal C} f\dd x$ is the usual integral of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$.

\bigskip
Let's move now to $\R^2$.  Let $f_x:\R^2\to\R$ and $f_y:\R^2\to\R$
and consider the 1-form $\bm\alpha = f_x\dd x+f_y\dd y$.  Again, let
$\mathcal C$ be an oriented curve starting at $\vec a$, ending at $\vec b$,
and parameterized by $\vec r:[0,1]\to\mathcal C$  where
$\vec r(t) = (r_x(t),r_y(t))$ and  $\vec r(0)=\vec a$ and
$\vec r(1)=\vec b$. 

Now,
\begin{align*}
	\int_{\mathcal C} \bm\alpha &= 
	\int_{\mathcal C} f_x\dd x+\int_{\mathcal C} f_y\dd y\\
	&=\int_0^1 f_x\circ \vec r(t)\, \dd x\formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}\,\d t
	+\int_0^1 f_y\circ \vec r(t)\, \dd y\formarg{\vec r(t)}{\vec r'(t)}\,\d t\\
	&= \int_0^1 f_x\circ \vec r(t)\, r_x'(t)\,\d t
	+\int_0^1 f_y\circ \vec r(t)\, r_y'(t)\,\d t
\end{align*}
If we let $\vec F = (f_x,f_y)$, a familiar integral emerges.
\[
	\int_{\mathcal C} \bm\alpha = \int_0^1 \vec F\circ \vec r(t) \cdot \vec r'(t)\,\d t
	=\int_{\mathcal C} \vec F\cdot \d\vec r,
\]
where the right-hand side is the vector line integral of $\vec F$ along the curve
$\mathcal C$.  So, integrals of 1-forms along curves are actually vector line
integrals.

\begin{example}
	Let $\bm \alpha=-y\dd x+x\dd y$ and let $\mathcal C$ be the circle of
	radius 2 centered at the origin.  Compute $\int_C \bm\alpha$.

	XXX Finish
\end{example}

\section{2-forms and Surface Integrals}

\subsection{The Wedge Product}


We can think of covectors as measuring oriented line segments.  That is,
any vector you can think of as a line segment with a start and an end.
When the covector $\bm\alpha=a\bm e^1+b\bm e^2+c\bm e^3$ is applied to 
a vector $\vec v$, it measures the ``$(a,b,c)$ component'' of $\vec v$.
In other words, it measures how long $\vec v$ appears to be from the perspective
of the vector $(a,b,c)$.  That is, $\bm\alpha(\vec v) = (a,b,c)\cdot \vec v$.

We can invent a similar object that measures oriented parallelograms.
Any pair of vectors $(\vec v,\vec w)$ can be viewed as forming an oriented
parallelogram $\mathcal P_{\vec v,\vec w}$.  If $(\vec v,\vec w)$ come in a
right-handed order, we say $\mathcal P_{\vec v,\vec w}$ has a positive
orientation.  Otherwise it has a negative orientation.
A function
that takes in a pair of vectors and measures the oriented (signed)
area of the parallelogram they determine is called a 2-covector.

Let us take a moment to discuss the \emph{laws of area}\footnote{ We'll be
calling them \emph{laws of volume} later on.} that should
apply to 2-covector.  If $\bm\alpha$ is a 2-covector and $\vec v,\vec w$ are
vectors, then
\[
	\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec v) = 0,
\]
since the parallelogram $\mathcal P_{\vec v,\vec v}$ is degenerate\footnote{
It isn't bad; it just has no area.}.  Scaling one of the sides should affect
the area accordingly:
\[
	\bm\alpha(m\vec v,\vec w) = m\alpha(\vec v,\vec w) = \alpha(\vec v,m\vec w).
\]
Further, if we slide one vector parallel to the other, it shouldn't affect
the area.  So,
\[
	\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec w) = \alpha(\vec v+m\vec w,\vec w) = \alpha(\vec v,\vec w+m\vec v).
\]

Lastly, though not a direct consequence of the laws of area,
we will require that $\bm\alpha$ is linear in each argument.
That is, that $\bm\alpha$ is \emph{multi-linear}\index{multi-linear}.

\begin{definition}[Multi-linear]
	A function $f:\underbrace{V\times \cdots\times V}_{n}\to W$ is
	\emph{multi-linear} if it is linear in each argument.
	That is, for all $\vec v_1,\ldots, \vec v_n,\vec w\in V$ and 
	all scalars $\alpha$,
	\[
		f(\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_i+\vec w,\ldots,\vec v_n)
		=
		f(\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_i,\ldots,\vec v_n) +
		f(\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec w,\ldots,\vec v_n)
	\]
	and
	\[
		f(\vec v_1,\ldots,\alpha\vec v_i,\ldots,\vec v_n)
		=
		\alpha f(\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_i,\ldots,\vec v_n).
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[2-covector]
	A \emph{2-covector} on the vector space $V$ is a multi-linear
	function $\bm\alpha: V\times V\to \R$ that obeys the laws of area.
\end{definition}

The laws of area should look very familiar from our 
derivation of the cross product.  And, now we can see that orientation
is a direct consequence of multi-linearity and the fact that $\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec v)=0$.
Observe,
\begin{align*}
	0=\bm\alpha(\vec v+\vec w, \vec v+\vec w) &= 
		\bm\alpha(\vec v, \vec v)+
		\bm\alpha(\vec v, \vec w)+
		\bm\alpha(\vec w, \vec v)+
		\bm\alpha(\vec w,\vec w)\\
		&=\bm\alpha(\vec v, \vec w)+
		\bm\alpha(\vec w, \vec v),
\end{align*}
and so $\bm\alpha(\vec v, \vec w) = -\bm\alpha(\vec w, \vec v)$.  This property
is called \emph{alternating}\index{alternating map}.

We've generated a lot of theory, but let's actually see a 2-vector in action.

\begin{example}
	\label{EXTWOCOVECTOR}
	For a pair of vectors $(\vec v,\vec w)$, let $\mathcal P_{\vec v,\vec w}$
	be the oriented parallelogram with sides $\vec v$ and $\vec w$.
	Let $\bm\alpha$ be the 2-covector so that $\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec w)$
	is the oriented area of $\mathcal P_{\vec v,\vec w}$ projected onto the
	$xy$-plane.

	XXX Figure

	Let $\vec v=(v_x,v_y,v_z)$ and $\vec w=(w_x,w_y,w_z)$ be the components
	of $\vec v$ and $\vec w$.  Using components, the projection of each
	vector onto the $xy$-plane is given by $(v_x,v_y,0)$ and $(w_x,w_y,0)$.
	We can compute the oriented area of this parallelogram in the $xy$-plane
	using the cross product, which
	results in the formula
	\[
		\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec w) = v_xw_y-v_yw_x.
	\]
	It is left to the reader to verify that $\bm\alpha$ satisfies the area
	laws and is multi-linear.
\end{example}

The 2-covector $\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec w) = v_xw_y-v_yw_x$ from Example \ref{EXTWOCOVECTOR}
is interesting because it only relies on the $x$ and $y$ components of its
input vectors. And, the covectors $\bm e^1$ and $\bm e^2$ measure the $x$ and
$y$ components of their input!  Thus, we could write
\[
	\bm\alpha(\vec v,\vec w) = \bm e^1(\vec v)\bm e^2(\vec w) - \bm e^2(\vec v)\bm{e}^1(\vec w).
\]
There's a beautiful symmetry to that formula---so beautiful that it is encapsulated
in a concept called the \emph{wedge product}\index{wedge product}.

\begin{definition}[Wedge Product]
	Let $\bm \alpha$ and $\bm \beta$ be covectors.  The \emph{wedge product}
	(also known as the \emph{exterior product}\index{exterior product})
	is notated $\bm\alpha\wedge\bm\beta$ and is defined by
	\[
		\bm\alpha\wedge\bm\beta (\vec v,\vec w)
		=\bm\alpha(\vec v)\bm\beta(\vec w) - \bm\beta(\vec v)\bm\alpha(\vec w).
	\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	If $\bm \alpha$ and $\bm \beta$ be covectors then the wedge
	product $\bm\alpha\wedge\bm\beta$ is a 2-covector.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 	XXX Finish
\end{proof}

We now see that our area-in-the-$xy$-plane 2-covector from before could
be written as $\bm e^1\wedge \bm e^2$.  But, it gets better.

\begin{theorem}
	Every 2-covector can be represented as a linear combination
	of vectors in the set $\Set{\bm e^i\wedge \bm e^j\given i\neq j}$.
\end{theorem}

Exploring the consequences of the definition of the wedge product, 
we see that the wedge product is anti-symmetric:
\[
	\bm\alpha\wedge \bm \beta = -\bm\alpha\wedge \bm\beta.
\]
And, that it is multi-linear:
\[
	(m\bm\alpha)\wedge \bm \beta = m(\bm\alpha\wedge \bm \beta)
	=\bm\alpha\wedge (m \bm \beta)
\]
\[
	(\bm\alpha+\bm\gamma)\wedge \bm\beta = \bm\alpha\wedge\bm\beta + \bm\gamma\wedge \bm\beta
\]
\[
	\bm\alpha\wedge(\bm\gamma+\bm\beta) = \bm\alpha\wedge\bm\gamma + \bm\alpha\wedge\bm\beta.
\]

Strangely, 2-covectors seem to have all the properties of their inputs.

\subsection{Geometric Interpretation of 2-covectors}

XXX Finish.  Some pictures about projections and oriented areas, again.

\subsection{2-forms}

Now that we have 2-covectors, we can define 2-forms\index{2-form} in a very similar way to
how we defined 1-forms.

\begin{definition}[2-form]
	A \emph{2-form} on the space $\R^n$ is a function $\bm\alpha:
	\R^n\to \Set{\text{2-covectors for }\R^n}$.
\end{definition}

Just like 2-covectors could be constructed by taking the wedge product
of covectors, 2-forms can be constructed by taking the wedge product of
1-forms.  2-forms in $\R^3$ also have a standard basis.

\begin{definition}[Standard Basis for 2-forms]
	The standard basis for 2-forms on $\R^3$ are the 2-forms
	$\dd x\wedge \dd y$, $\dd y\wedge \dd z$, and $\dd z \wedge \dd x$.
\end{definition}
